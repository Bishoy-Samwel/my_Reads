## About Project

"My Reads" is A web application for managing e-library, I have been  working with the real live data from the reactnd-books-api. 

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:
*  Currently Reading     
*  Want to Read     
*  Read

The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.
